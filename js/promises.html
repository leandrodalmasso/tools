  We have:
  - A 'producing code' that does something that takes time
  - A 'consuming code' that wants the result of the 'producing code'

  A promise is a JS object that links the 'producing code' and the 'consuming code'.

  It can be resolved with a value or rejected with an error.

  Consuming functions will receive the result or the error.
